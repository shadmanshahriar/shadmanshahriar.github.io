                  <h3>I'm learning to become a Back End Web Developer.</h3>
                  <p>I am currently a High School Student, soon I'd be done with High School and would try and continue my higher studies abroad.
                      I am vastly interested in technology as it never fails to amaze/cease me. Hopefully I'd be able to persue my dream. 
                      I also am interested in listening music, love to watch binge watch shows and anime. From sports I'd say everything entices me
                       but Football has a special place in my heart and it is a Sport which I equallly love to both play and watch. As of now I study
                      in Notre Dame College. Our HSC exams have been postponed and no specific date has been announced yet for that, decided to learn
                      to code this site from scratch.<br><br> Online classes have been an experience to remember as being a citizen of Bangladesh we 
                      have always dreamt of doing things which would help us advance into the world and experience things which technology had gifted
                      us. From about 2-3 years ago this sounded like a miracle but life had to take a drastic turn and humans as they always have 
                      adapted to the change. The present day world has evolved alot, so have the people been. I can say I have developed healthy habits
                      from my time in home staying isolated with my own thoughts. Every human has possibly faced  it. During the hard times we should 
                      try and remember the happier times so that we can understand, better days are yet to come. </p>

                  <h2>Our Services</h2>
                  <p>As you see the services below, not all are currently available as I am aspiring l=to learn as I go, but looks neat as I put it out there on my own website which I am making from scratch. Hopefully I would be able to reach the goals I have set one day! One step at a time lesgooo</p>

                    <h2>Web Design</h2>
                    <p>Yes, as it falls under CSS, I can actually design websites. Every day I see new designs as I surf the web, taking inspiration from different designs, themes and even color palettes too! Designing websites are fun as well as you can literally customise the website according to your own preferences and can always go back and make some adjustments.</p>

                <h2>Web Development</h2>
                <p>I can make websites the basic ones and trying to learn the higher skilled ones. This website which you are currently visiting is completely made from scratch. I had an urge to learn how to make websites solely because it is fun to make once I know my stuff around! You can literally do anything with some words and symbols, even make your presence on internet be felt!</p>

            <h2>Android App</h2>
            <p>I am putting my efforts in learning python as I go, so far have dialed down quite a bit of the python for web developing. Apps are very unique and I have my curiousity to make one app, hopefully someday I would make my own app as a prototype. Journey begins with a single step and this website is my first ever step, let's see what the future holds!</p>

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>I do photography, sadly don't own a camera but I do it with my mobile phone, the best I could. You can always check out @tourgasm_  where I usually post my photos! Sadly the pandemic harshly treated us and couldn't be at places to click more of those breathtaking photos :(</p>

    <h2>Content Writing</h2>
    <p>I and my team at BYSES(you can find us on Facebook) often post contents about space and the celestial bodies floating around in the vast universe. The world outside earth is quite different and with a goal to make people familiar of the outside world, me and my friends decided to open BYSES. Check us out here: https://www.facebook.com/BYSES21</p>

    <h2>Video Editing</h2>
    <p>I haven't had any experience on video editing. It really has a great demand in the market I presume so why not give it a go some other time! As the wise have said, "Why be a master of one when you can be the jack of all trades and the master of one!"</p>
